      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Previously, as a Research Assistant at the Lahore University of Management 
        Sciences (LUMS), worked on blockchain applications in renewable energy
        systems. My research interest focuses on blockchain technology and its 
        applications, including cryptocurrencies, tokenization of real-world assets, 
        DeFi, and Artificial Intelligence.

        Prior to joining LUMS, I worked at the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences
        and Technology as a Research Assistant for one year, and at CCIXER Inc. as a
        Research Associate for six months. I completed my Bachelor's in Software
        Engineering from COMSATS University Islamabad, Abbottabad Campus, in 2022.

        My academic and professional journey has been shaped by a strong interest in
        distributed systems, cryptoeconomics, and real-world applications of
        blockchain technologies. Alongside my research work, I also mentored bachelor'
        students in blockchain development, and efficient smart contract design
        using tools such as Remix IDE, Hardhat, and Truffle.

        I belong to the northern areas of Pakistan, Swat. I attended middle school at
        Swat Public School and College, and high school at Cadet College Swat. Apart from
        coding, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and playing cricket and badminton. I actively
        participate in community initiatives and volunteer activities whenever I can.
